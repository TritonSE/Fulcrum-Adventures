# Frontend:

1. install expo go on your phone
2. cd frontend, npm install, npm start, scan qr code on your phone
3. when developing: when you save it should auto reload. console logs appear in terminal, shake your device for debugging, and if you need to clear cache use npm start -- -c.
4. if you need to add react native libraries: do npx expo install to pick compatible versions

no backend needed for now!
